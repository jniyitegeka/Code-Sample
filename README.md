# Data Analysis & Coding Samples

## Overview
This repository contains sample scripts in Stata, R, Python, and ODK that demonstrate my experience with data analysis, statistical modeling, and survey design.

## Code Samples
Each script represents a sample of my work. If I was not the sole contributor, I have included annotations to clarify my contributions.

### 1️⃣ Stata: `analysis_script.do`
- Performs regression analysis and summary statistics on survey data.
- Annotated with comments explaining methodology.
- [View Script](https://github.com/jniyitegeka/Econ-970-Final-Project/blob/main/score.do)

### 2️⃣ Python: `machine_learning_model.py`
- Implements a simple linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
